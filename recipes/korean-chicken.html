        <h2>Korean Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>
            The secret to the chickens incredible, light and crisp exterior comes down to two key details: the potato starch used to coat the chicken and the double-fry method. Between the delightfully crackly texture, the aromatic flavor worked into the chicken via its ginger-salt rub, and the dynamic heat of the gochujang sauce, this Korean fried chicken is guaranteed to impress.

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the chicken: Preheat oven to 200&#8457;. Pour oil into a large cast-iron skillet, and fit with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-high until thermometer reaches 375&#8457;</li>
                <li>Toss together chicken, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until evenly coated. Place 1/2 cup of potato starch in a shallow dish. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, place in starch, and toss to coat completely and evenly. Tap off excess, and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
                <li>When oil is ready, place about 6 pieces of chicken in hot oil; fry until lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip chicken, and fry another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with a rack. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
                <li>When all chicken has been fried once, return chicken, in batches, back to oil to fry again, about 2 minutes per side. Place finished chicken on a separate baking sheet lined with a wire rack, and place in preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
                <li>Prepre the sauce, stir together gochujang, oyster sauce, mirin, ketchup, fish sauce, and garlic in a medium bowl. Toss chicken with desired amount of sauce, serve immediately. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
